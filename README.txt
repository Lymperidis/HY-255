The exercise asks you to create an abstract data type (ADT) called a SymTable. 
Each instance of SymTable ADT will be a symbol table. 
You need to design the SymTable ADT to be "general"
, i.e. values to be void pointers, and therefore to be able to 
show on data of any type.

You will create two implementations of SymTable ADT: one 
implementation that uses an interlinked list and one 
that uses a hash table.

The SymTable ADT you create will serve you later.
