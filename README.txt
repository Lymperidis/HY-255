In this excercise we will simulate a overload buffer attack.
The point is by looking at the Assembly and GDB we can see how many 
bytes is the buffer so if we overload this buffer with useless bytes 
it will end up messing around the return register and generally the stack of the programm.
In that way we can have access to the memory of the data base and change my grade from a 5 to a 10.
